In this lab I learned how to use the terminal to create files and push them to a github repo
I created a polynomial class that stores a polynomial
The only field of the class is a double array that stores the coefficients of the polynomial
There are 2 constructors
- One stores the polynomial 0 and doesn't take any arguments
- One stores any polynomial. It takes an array of polynomial coefficients as an argument
The class has methods add, evaluate, and hasRoot
add adds the stored polynomial with a polynomial passed as an argument and returns the new polynomial
evaluate evaluates the stored polynomial at a passed double, x, and returns the evaluation as a double
hasRoot returns whether or not the stored polynomial has a root at a passed double, x
